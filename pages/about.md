In December 2016, Muckrock reporter [Curtis Waltman](https://twitter.com/chwaltman) filed a [Freedom of Information Act request to the United States Drug Enforcement Administration](https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/patch-program-30852/). Waltman requested:
> * any index of DEA patches created from 1970 to the present date.
> * documents detailing the DEA patch creation process
> * any funding or expenditure documents related to the creation of patches
> * guidelines or manuals for creating DEA patches
> * internal policies regarding patches and what designs are appropriate

In March 2017, he received a [197-page PDF](https://cdn.muckrock.com/foia_files/2017/03/09/3-6-17_MR30852_RES_ID17-00182-F.pdf) containing 34 images. Those are the images that are presented here, in a searchable gallery powered by [Wax](https://minicomp.github.io/wax/).
